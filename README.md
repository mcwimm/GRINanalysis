# GRINanalysis

This repository contains data and analyses of the manuscript entitled "Roots of cooperation: Can root graft networks benefit trees under stress?", currently under Review at Nature-plants 2020.

The following lines detail de information included in this repository

### 1) Data

This folder contains the raw data (csv-files) and processed data (rda-files) to run the analysis and create the figures.

**Raw data**

- Networks.rda: graft data, contains only information of grafted trees in a from-to format, where trees in column "Tree1" in grafted to trees in column "Tree2" 

**Processed data**

  - LMtrees.rda: contains data (e.g. unique ID, coordinates, species, DBH, graft-status, â€¦) for each tree in the study area, resulting from merging raw data bases of tree attrubutes (publicly available at https://doi. org/10.5525/gla.researchdata.657) and field mapping of root connections through root grafts (Networks.rda)
  - LMavis.rda: is a subset of LMtrees.rda containing only Avicennia germinans trees, but also additional information as the salinity group of the study plot and the cumulated grafting probability of each tree.
  - LMlinks.rda: contains all grafted pairs of trees with additional information like the distance between them or the group they belong to.
  - LMgroups.rda: contains all groups of grafted trees with additional information as the number of trees and the number of links within each group.


### 2) Analysis

This folder contains

- The multilevel logistic regression model described in the extended data section (_glmer_grafting.R_)
- The computations to extract the indices of competition (Hegyi) and neighbourhood asymmetri, the latter used on the Generalised additive mixed effects model (GAMM). This script also contains the necesary code to repoduce Figures 2B from the Main document, Extended data Figures 3 and 4, as well as Supplementary information Figures 1 and 2 
_ The comparisson between power-law distribution and other random-process distribution functions

### 3) Figures

This folder contains the scripts needed to reproduce figures present in the Manuscript (including those in Extended Data and Supplementary Information Files)
Only the scripts to build Fig. 1 of the Main document are not yet inclued to date (17th July 2020), these was combined from 3 different R obsects (Mexico's country map, Study site GIS image, and grafted tree maps) and were further combined using GIMP V.2.10. We are working on uplading such scripts and will be updated as soon as possible
